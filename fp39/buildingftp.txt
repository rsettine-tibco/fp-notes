trocadero:/opt/kabira/users/rsettine/ftp/paftp/linux/include => dmake BUILD=ALL
trocadero:/opt/kabira/users/rsettine/ftp/paftp/linux/libsrc => dmake BUILD=ALL
trocadero:/opt/kabira/users/rsettine/ftp/paftp/linux/src => dmakeBUILD=ALL

In case, any intermediate error, and like to clean, then run => dmake clobber or dmake clobberdc

When there is error for missing header file, then check for the same under below directories
# ls $SW_HOME/distrib/kabira/include
# ls $SW_HOME/distrib/kabira/lib


Other notes:
Was getting below error on first time building.
============
In file included from ./paftp_priv.h:20,
                 from paftp_dimpl.cpp:15:
./paftp.h:21:25: error: globbuiltin.h: No such file or directory
[Info]    : dmake:  Error code 1, while making 'devobj/paftp_dimpl.o'
dmake:  Error code 255, while making 'recursive'
[Fatal]   : dmake failed.
Build failed
dmake:  Error code 250, while making '/opt/kabira/users/rsettine/BUILD/paftp/paftpALL.bldtype'
=============
The above got addressed when build from ftp/paftp/linux/include; this has copied the globbuiltin.h under $SW_HOME/distrib/kabira/include directory.
